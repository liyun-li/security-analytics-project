# Gazetteer

Wikipedia has a pretty good explanation:

> A gazetteer is a geographical dictionary or directory used in conjunction with a map or atlas.[1] It typically contains information concerning the geographical makeup, social statistics and physical features of a country, region, or continent. Content of a gazetteer can include a subject's location, dimensions of peaks and waterways, population, gross domestic product and literacy rate. This information is generally divided into topics with entries listed in alphabetical order.
